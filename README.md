# almapipy: Python Wrapper for Alma API

almapipy is python requests wrapper for easily accessing the Ex Libris Alma API. It is designed to be lightweight, and imposes a structure that mimics the [Alma API architecture](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/alma/apis).

## Installation
```pip install almapipy```

## Progress and Roadmap
Get functionality has been developed around all the Alma APIs (listed below).
Post, Put and Delete functions will be gradually added in future releases.

| API | Get | Post | Put | Delete |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [bibs](#access-bibliographic-data) | X | | | |
| [analytics](#access-reports) | X | NA | NA | NA |
| [acquisitions](#access-acquisitions) | X | | | |
| [configuration](#access-configuration-settings) | X | | | |
| [courses](#access-courses) | X | | | |
| [resource sharing partners](#access-resource-sharing-partners) | X | | | |

## Use

### Import
```python
# Import and call primary Client class
from almapipy import AlmaCnxn
alma = AlmaCnxn('your_api_key', format='json')
```
### Access Bibliographic Data
Alma provides a set of Web services for handling bibliographic records related information, enabling you to quickly and easily manipulate bibliographic records related details. These Web services can be used by external systems to retrieve or update bibliographic records related data.
```python

harry_potter = "9980963346303126"
bib_record = alma.bibs.catalog.get(harry_potter)

# get holding items for a bib record
holdings = alma.bibs.catalog.get_holdings(harry_potter)

# get loans by title
loans = alma.bibs.loans.get_by_title(harry_potter)
# or by a specific holding item
loans = alma.bibs.loans.get_by_item(harry_potter, holding_id, item_id)

# get requests or availability of bib
alma.bibs.requests.get_by_title(harry_potter)
alma.bibs.requests.get_by_item(harry_potter, holding_id, item_id)
alma.bibs.requests.get_availability(harry_potter, period=20)

# get digital representations
alma.bibs.representations.get(harry_potter)

# get linked data
alma.bibs.linked_data.get(harry_potter)
```

### Access Reports
The Analytics API returns an Alma report.
```python
# Find the system path to the report if don't know path
alma.analytics.paths.get('/shared')

# retrieve the report as an XML ET element (native response)
report = alma.analytics.reports.get('path_to_report')

report = alma.analytics.reports.get('path_to_report', return_json = True)
```

### Access Courses
Alma provides a set of Web services for handling courses and reading lists related information, enabling you to quickly and easily manipulate their details. These Web services can be used by external systems such as Courses Management Systems to retrieve or update courses and reading lists related data.
```python
# Get a complete list of courses. Makes multiple calls if necessary.
course_list = alma.courses.get(all_records = True)

# or filter on search parameters
econ_courses = alma.courses.get(query = {'code': 'ECN'})

# get reading lists for a course
course_id = econ_courses['course'][0]['id']
reading_lists = alma.courses.reading_lists.get(course_id)

# get more detailed information about a specific reading list
reading_list_id = reading_lists['reading_list'][0]['id']
alma.courses.reading_lists(course_id, reading_list_id, view = 'full')

# get citations for a reading list
alma.courses.citations(course_id, reading_list_id)
```

### Access Users
Alma provides a set of Web services for handling user information, enabling you to quickly and easily manipulate user details. These Web services can be used by external systems—such as student information systems (SIS)—to retrieve or update user data.
```python

users = alma.users.get(query = {'first_name': 'Sterling', 'last_name': 'Archer'})

# get more information on that user
user_id = users['user'][0]['primary_id']
alma.users.get(user_id)

# get all loans or requests for a user. Makes multiple calls if necessary.
loans = alma.user.loans.get(user_id, all_records = True)
requests = alma.user.requests.get(user_id, all_records = True)

# get deposits or fees for a user
deposits = alma.users.deposits.get(user_id)
fees = alma.users.fees.get(user_id)
```

# or by a specific line number
alma.acq.po_lines.get(single_line_id)

# search for a vendor
alma.acq.vendors.get(status='active', query={'name':'AMAZON'})
# or get a specific vendor
alma.acq.vendors.get('AMAZON.COM')

# get invoices or polines for a specific vendor
alma.acq.vendors.get_invoices('AMAZON.COM')
alma.acq.vendors.get_po_lines('AMAZON.COM')

# or get specific invoices

# Get libraries, locations, departments, and hours
libraries = alma.conf.units.get_libaries()
library_id = libraries['library'][0]['code']
locations = alma.conf.units.get_locations(library_id)
hours = alma.conf.general.get_hours(library_id)
departments = alma.conf.units.get_departments()

# Get system code tables
table = 'UserGroups'
alma.conf.general.get_code_table(table)

# Get scheduled jobs and run history
jobs = alma.conf.jobs.get()
job_id = jobs['job'][0]['id']
run_history = alma.conf.jobs.get_instances(job_id)

# Get sets and set members
sets = alma.conf.sets.get()
set_id = sets['set'][0]['id']
set_members = alma.conf.sets.get_members(set_id)

# get profiles and reminders
depost_profiles = alma.conf.deposit_profiles.get()
import_profiles = alma.conf.import_profiles.get()
reminders = alma.conf.reminders.get()
```
